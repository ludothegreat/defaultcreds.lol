# Web Fix Report

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-05T00-47-49Z

## Hypothesis Addressed

Low: Weather forecast uses `innerHTML` with API data in `weather/index.html`.

## Files Changed

- `weather/index.html`
- `docs/web-analysis/progress.md`

## What Changed

- Replaced `innerHTML` rendering of weather forecast blocks with DOM node creation and `textContent` to avoid HTML injection.

## Validation

- Opened `http://localhost:8000/weather/index.html` via Chrome DevTools MCP.
- Verified forecast content renders correctly in snapshot.
- Checked console messages: none.

## Outcome

✅ **Success** — weather forecast now renders without `innerHTML`.

## Next Recommended Action

Run `web-fix.md` again to address the next issue in `docs/web-analysis/progress.md`.
