# Web Fix Report

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-05T03:46:40Z

## Hypothesis Addressed

Medium: Potential XSS in search highlighting (RSS titles re-injected via `innerHTML`) in `js/modules/search-filter.js`.

## Files Changed

- `js/modules/search-filter.js`
- `docs/web-analysis/progress.md`

## What Changed

- Replaced `innerHTML`-based highlighting with safe DOM node construction using `textContent` and `<mark>` elements.

## Validation

- Opened `http://localhost:8000/` via Chrome DevTools MCP.
- Searched for `ransomware` and confirmed highlight marks render without using `innerHTML`.
- Checked console: no errors.

## Outcome

✅ **Success** — search highlighting no longer re-injects HTML.

## Next Recommended Action

Run `web-analyze.md` to confirm no remaining issues.
