# Web Fix Report

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-05T03:57:17Z

## Hypothesis Addressed

Low: CORS enabled for all routes in Flask dev server (`app.py:10-14`).

## Outcome

⚠️ **Skipped** — server files (including `app.py`) are excluded from commits per repo guidance, so no code change was applied.

## Next Recommended Action

Run `web-fix.md` again to address the remaining low-priority HTTPS dev server bind setting in `server.py`, if you want that change tracked in git.
