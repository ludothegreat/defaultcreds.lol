# Fix Report - Conflicting Visual States: Selected but Inactive

**Timestamp:** 2026-01-16T17:21:36Z  
**Target Issue:** Conflicting Visual States: Selected but Inactive  
**Hypothesis:** Feeds can be selected (green background) but inactive (dimmed, disabled), creating confusing visual state

## Issue Summary

Feeds could simultaneously have:
- `data-selected="true"` → green background (`rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.15)`)
- `data-active="false"` → dimmed (opacity 0.4), disabled (pointer-events: none)

This created a confusing visual where feeds appeared "selected" (green background) but were dimmed and unclickable, suggesting they were inactive.

## Files Changed

- `styles.css` (lines 754-760)

## What Was Changed

Modified the CSS selector for selection highlighting to require both `data-selected="true"` AND `data-active="true"`. This ensures the green background only appears when a feed is both selected and active.

**Before:**
```css
.feed-option[data-selected="true"] {
  background: var(--color-accent-soft);
}

.feed-option[data-selected="true"]:hover {
  background: var(--color-highlight);
}
```

**After:**
```css
.feed-option[data-selected="true"][data-active="true"] {
  background: var(--color-accent-soft);
}

.feed-option[data-selected="true"][data-active="true"]:hover {
  background: var(--color-highlight);
}
```

## Why This Fix Works

By requiring both `data-selected="true"` AND `data-active="true"` for the green background, we ensure that:
1. **Visual Consistency**: Green background only appears when the feed is both selected AND active
2. **Clear State Indication**: Inactive feeds (even if selected) don't show the green background, making it clear they're not currently active
3. **Reduced Confusion**: Users won't see feeds that look "selected" but are actually disabled

The selection state (`data-selected`) is still maintained in the data model, but the visual highlighting only appears when the feed is also active, creating a more intuitive user experience.

## Validation Results

**Test Method:** Browser testing with Playwright connected to Chrome DevTools

**Test Scenario:**
1. Selected a feed (The Register Security, Category: Industry Press)
2. Deactivated its category (Industry Press)
3. Verified the feed became `data-selected="true"` and `data-active="false"`

**Before Fix:**
- Feed would have green background even when inactive
- Confusing visual state: selected but disabled

**After Fix:**
- Feed with `data-selected="true"` and `data-active="false"`:
  - Background: `rgb(18, 18, 18)` (default, no green)
  - Opacity: `0.4` (dimmed, as expected for inactive)
  - No green background ✅

**Validation:** ✅ SUCCESS - Fix confirmed working

## Outcome

✅ **SUCCESS** - Issue resolved. The green selection background now only appears when feeds are both selected AND active, eliminating the confusing visual state where feeds appeared selected but were actually inactive.
