# Testing

## Current State

- No automated test framework is configured.
- No `package.json`, CI config, or dedicated test folder is present.

## Ad Hoc Verification

- Manual browser testing is the primary validation method.
- Optional local scripts exist in repo root for inspection, but they are now ignored by Git and intended for local use only.

## Gaps

- No unit, integration, or end-to-end tests.
- No linting or formatting automation.
