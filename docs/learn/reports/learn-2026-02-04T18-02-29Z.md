## Context Loaded

- Global context: `/hoard/ai/prompts/global-context.md`
- Repo context: none found (`AGENTS.md` not present)

## What Was Learned

- The app is a static, client-side news dashboard driven by RSS feeds.
- `js/news.js` is the orchestration layer and ties together state, UI, and feed rendering.
- Feed data is cached in `localStorage`, enabling quick reloads while fetching fresh content.
- UI behavior is modularized into focused JS modules under `js/modules/`.
- The UI emphasizes a terminal-inspired dark aesthetic with loading skeleton animations.

## Architecture Highlights

- Cache-first feed rendering with background refresh.
- State persisted in `localStorage` for user preferences and feed state.
- Feed health and “last updated” shown in sidebar as live status indicators.

## Key Conventions

- Vanilla JS modules with explicit imports/exports.
- CSS design tokens centralized under `:root`.
- Feature-specific modules for search, sorting, and feed controls.

## Notable Dependencies

- `rss-parser` from CDN for feed parsing.
- AllOrigins CORS proxy for RSS retrieval.
- GitHub API + SecLists for the “Cred of the Week” widget.

## Recommendations for Next Steps

- If you want a deeper health check, run `/hoard/ai/prompts/check.md`.
- For issue discovery, use `/hoard/ai/prompts/analyze.md`.
